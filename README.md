# Learning Platform - Quiz Module

## Project Overview

The Learning Platform - Quiz Module is designed to provide a dynamic and engaging learning experience for users. The project focuses on user authentication, management, multiple-answer questions (MAQ), scoring, and leaderboard features. This initial phase aims to establish a foundation for user interaction and knowledge assessment.

## Features

### 1. User Authentication

- Internal authentication handled securely by the website.
- User credentials stored securely.

### 2. User Management

- Two user roles: User (UX/UI, frontend, and backend access) and Manager (backend access only).
- User hierarchy implemented as per the vision outlined.

### 3. Multiple-Answer Questions (MAQ)

- Questions and answers stored in a database with a dynamic structure.
- Randomized order of answer presentation for each user interaction.
- Feedback provided to the user after submitting an answer.

### 4. Scoring

- Users earn 3 points for correct answers and 1 point for incorrect answers.
- User responses and scores stored in the database.
- Randomized presentation of questions to ensure variety.

### 5. Leaderboard

- Total scores displayed for each user and team.
- Future releases may introduce additional metrics and views.

## Implementation Details

### Technology Stack

- Frontend: UX/UI, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB (for user data, questions, and scores)

### Authentication

- Secure authentication mechanisms implemented internally.
- User credentials securely stored and managed.

### User Management

- User roles managed to ensure proper access control.
- Backend functionality provided for manager-specific operations.

### Multiple-Answer Questions

- Dynamic question-answer sets stored in the database.
- Randomization of answer order implemented for a varied user experience.
- Feedback mechanisms designed for user interaction.

### Scoring System

- User scores tracked and stored in the database.
- Randomization of question presentation to prevent predictability.

### Leaderboard

- Total scores per user and team displayed.
- Future releases may introduce additional metrics and views.

## Future Enhancements

- More sophisticated user analytics.
- Advanced question types.
- Enhanced leaderboard features and metrics.
- Integration with other learning modules.

## Project Timeline

- **Phase 1:** Implementation of User Authentication and Management (4 weeks).
- **Phase 2:** Integration of Multiple-Answer Questions, Scoring System, and Leaderboard (6 weeks).
- **Phase 3:** Testing, Bug Fixes, and Documentation (2 weeks).

## Conclusion

The Learning Platform - Quiz Module serves as an interactive and dynamic tool for knowledge assessment and user engagement. It provides a solid foundation for future enhancements and expansions, making it a valuable asset for continuous learning.
